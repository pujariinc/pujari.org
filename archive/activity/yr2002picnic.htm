      <h4>A Comment from BAGA President.</h4>
      <p>&quot;The Executive Committee of BAGA would like to thank &quot;PUJARI&quot;
      and the &quot;PICNIC Committee&quot; for putting together an enjoyable
      afternoon filled with lots of food and fun for everyone. It was a result
      of meticulous planning by the &quot;PICNIC Committee&quot; and high levels
      of cooperation between the two organizing clubs. Even the &quot;Weather
      Gods&quot; cooperated in appreciation! Everyone present had a very good
      time. A big round of applause is also due to the &quot;Clean-up
      Crew&quot;- I have received word from the Administrator at East Roswell
      Park that they will refund our deposit of $50.00......... I hope the
      PICNIC sets the staging ground for more collaborative endeavors.&quot;</p>
