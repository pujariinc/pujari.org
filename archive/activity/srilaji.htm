style='font-size:11.0pt'>The Acharya hails from TAMIL NADU part of South-India.
He was raised in the ambience of religious orthodoxy, doctrinal purity and
blemishless Vaishnava etiquette. From the early childhood, he was introduced to
fundamental spiritual concepts and received a trained exposure to various
theological expositions of contemporary schools of thoughts as he gradually
grew up.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>He
is conversant with the philosophical nuances of great Vaishnava Acharyas like
Shri Ramanuj, Shri Nimbark, Shri Vishnuswami and Shri Madhv. He also became
familiar with the concepts of monist philosophers like Shripad Shankaracharya,
Ramkrishna, Vivekananda, Chinmayananda, Dr. Radhakrishnan and J. Krishnamurthy.
On the material platform, Shrila Maharaja started his career in Bangalore and
because of his enterprising personality later acquired executive positions in
internationally reputed Organizations in export marketing. This entailed him to
travel worldwide.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The
impact of his global social intercourse is very much evident in making even the
atheistic people sit up and ponder over philosophy of God consciousness when
presented by him with ingenuity and skill. Consequently, the perfection and
precision of Shrila Maharaja’s answers to philosophical queries leaves a
logician stunned; a sincere seeker melt in his heart with joy and a devotee to
start dancing in ecstasy. His expositions on the true purport of Bhagavat Gita
and ability to present the Science of Self-Realization have always been
received with admirable appreciation by audience wherever they were addressed
throughout the globe. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In
the year 1987, by divine arrangement, Shrila Maharaja happened to chance across
the book ‘Bhagavat Gita As it is’ published the world renowned Gaudiya
Vaishnava Acharya Shrila A.C. Bhakthivedanta Swami Prabhupada, which brought a
radical and instant transformation. His life changed forever. Shrila Maharaja
became so absorbed with the Gaudiya Vaishnava Philosophy that he spent eight
months of continuous and rigorous self-imposed exile to thoroughly understand,
deliberate and assimilate the Gaudiya Vaishnava teachings.</span></p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In
the year 1990, Shrila Maharaja, a Naishthik Brahmachari, was granted the renounced
order of life (Sannyasa) by his Spiritual Master, Shri B.S. Bhagavat Goswami
Maharaja, for the purpose of taking the message of God to every door and Shrila
Maharaja has never rested ever since. He engages himself in the service of the
Supreme Lord, Shri Krishna, 24 hours a day and his uncompromising attitude in
the pursuance of the scriptural principles and the orders of his spiritual
master, word to word, has won the hearts of unlimited number of men and women
alike. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Shrila
Maharaja was invited to grace The World Parliament of Religions held in Cape
Town, South Africa in 1999 with his presence and share his unfathomable
knowledge and realizations with people assembled from all parts of the globe. </span></p>
