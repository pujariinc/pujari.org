      Tuesday morning, September 11, 2001, our lives were changed forever as we
      experienced the most horrific tragedy of our lifetime. We were stunned
      with disbelief and then we cried with unbearable grief. We prayed with the
      nation. In the aftermath of this unprecedented tragedy, we begin to
      realize the need to do something positive. Here, let us stand together
      united as a single force and support this great nation in crisis.</td>
