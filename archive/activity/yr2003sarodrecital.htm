Kanthe Maharaj of 
Benaras and his mother Smt. 
Bharati  Bose, a keen Sitar player and a disciple of 
Mian Davir Khan, 
Ustad Mustaq Ali Khan and

seed of music in him by imparting the early lessons. Debojyoti
has received talim in Sarod
for over twenty years from Ustad Amjad
Ali Khan of Senia Banghas 
Gharana. His elder brother Pandit
Kumar Bose, a celebrated Tabla Nawaaz
of international repute, also gave him the fillip to venture into the world of
music. He received vocal guidance from Sri Jayanta
 Bose, his second brother, a vocalist of Bishnupur 
Gharana. Also he has received vocal guidance from 
Pandit Rajan and 
Sajan Mishra and 
Pandit Vijay Kichlu.</p>
