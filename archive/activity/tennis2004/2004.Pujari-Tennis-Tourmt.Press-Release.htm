non-profit organization that promotes the Asian Indian culture and heritage,
organized the 2nd South Asian Doubles Tennis Tournament in September. Pujari started
the tennis tournament last year – the inaugural tournament in 2003 drew large
participation from the South Asian Indian community in metro </span><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>Atlanta</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. This
year's event was a roaring success, and the participation went up by almost
50%. Pujari was fortunate this year to receive partial sponsorship from the
Cable/HSI/Media giant, <i>Comcast Corporation</i>.  In addition, Paige Miller, Director
of Marketing for the Georgia section of USTA, and the local affiliate of The Tennis
Channel (channel 127) were also generous enough to contribute towards the
tournament in the form of goodies like T-shirts, sweat shirts, and other
souvenirs. This year, twenty one teams participated in the tournament, which
was held over two Sundays (Sep 19th and Sep 26th) at the </span><span

facilities. The initial rounds were played in a partial round robin format on
the first Sunday, while the quarterfinal, semifinal, and the final rounds were
held on the following Sunday. The event was made particularly successful by the
sporting spirit and enthusiastic participation of the players, the organizers,
and their friends and families. The general quality of tennis in the tournament
was excellent, thus clearly demonstrating the abundance of tennis talent in the
metro Atlanta South Asian community.</span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The four semi-finalists were
Soumen Ghosh / Rahul Basole and Siva Kumar / Thiru Chittireddy in one half, and
Saravanan Pillai / Raghu Pani and Ashis Poddar / Ramji Veera in the other half.
The final match played between Raghu Pani / Saravanan Pillai (Raghu was a member
of the winning team in last year’s tournament) and Soumen Ghosh / Rahul Basole
provided the audience with some great tennis to watch as well as cheer for the
players. At the end, the defending champions prevailed, and won the match 6-4,
6-3.  Pujari presented the champions and the finalists with trophies, cash
prizes, and T-shirts. </span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The efforts of this year’s
organizing committee (Soumen Ghosh, Bhaskar Banerjee, Ashis Poddar, and Sudipto
Ghose) and the support they received from the Pujari Officers made this fun
event possible. Special thanks go to Debjyoti Roy for coordinating with the external
Sponsors, and Samaresh Mukhopadhyay for providing Web support. With this kind
of enthusiasm and positive feedback from the participants, Pujari is planning
for an even bigger event next time….please stay tuned! A significant portion of
the proceeds from this year’s tournament will go to charity.</span></p>
