		Well nice to know Bengali Culture &amp; its Heritage is being so prominent in 
		the USA. Good designing site but there are a few more ways to enhance the 
		beauty of the website... I comment the above lines as because I m a 
		professional website designer here in India. If give a chance to do a work on 
		the site I would feel proud. And would definitely give my best to it.

		The site is really good and well designed, to add more cream in it I would like 
		to say that speaking to Kallol da gave me more relief that Bengalis here are 
		still co-operative and he was really very helpful in telling me about the 
		association. I was interested in joining and the direction, I really thank him 
		and joining the association will really help me knowing more people of India 
		from here, so wish all the best and am looking forward joining the association. 
		my telephone no is 404-943-0233.

		As an admirer of Bengal, The Land of the Learned and the Bengali culture, I am 
		impressed by the professionally done web site with a lot of information 
		organized in a clear &amp; concise manner. Some day, I may ask for your help to 
		do the same for the web site of Gujarati Samaj of Atlanta.

		Very well-designed web site. I have two suggestions, not regarding the web 
		site. One, you may consider not sending post cards to those whose e-mail 
		addresses are known; can save some postage. Two. You could try to get some ads 
		for the web site - again to have some earnings. By the way, I will be attending 
		the Saraswati Puja. I could not reply to the RSVP persons because both their 
		e-mail addresses have apparently expired from YAHOO.

		This site is EXCELLENT. I liked each and every pages, arts, recipes, links etc. 
		Proud to have great guys like Kallol, Raktim around. You guys are working hard 
		to make a difference in lives of Bengalis at Atlanta. I am very happy to see 
		both Pujari and Baga have joined hands for a picnic. We plan to attend that. 
		.... how about combining Puja next year...? if both organizations have same 
		goals why not do a mega merger like HP and Compaq and set an example of unity 
		to other Indian communities)::? Cheers.

		Web-site with lot of information. Cool to browse. I was in Atlanta last week 
		and had delicious authentic Bengali food at Taj Mahal Restaurant, 4650 Jimmy 
		Carter Blvd, Suite 108 (Merchant Square Shopping Center). I was impressed by 
		the owner, Mr Shafiqur Rahman who shows pride in being a Bengali and serves 
		only Bengali food at his restaurant. He can be contacted on 770-496-0073.

		This is indeed a very well-thought-out and organized website, and Kallol, you 
		have done a great job keeping the links and pages up-to-date! I use your 
		"Links" as my gateway to everything Bengali now-a-days, including my daily dose 
		of Bangla Khobor and Rabindrasangeet.

		Hi - I am a Bengali from Calcutta and live here in Atlanta. I have a child 
		(2-year old) and as a parent I would like to expose him (in the future) to 
		Indian (and Bengali) culture, and language in a somewhat formal and structured 
		way [in a regular weekly class with a teacher(s), other students etc. in 
		addition to attending festival celebrations, gatherings of Bengalis .. Is there 
		any plan for such a class - for culture etc. exposure for our kids? I am very 
		interested in this matter and would highly appreciate if I could get some 
		information/ contact regarding this subject. Thank you.
