<p style="margin-bottom: 0">Two young people a man and a Woman woke up in a
sunny morning with delightful mood. Last night they had seen a Dream that they
founded a Map or direction for Gold mine. Next day they decided they would start
journey for the Dream Land! No matter at any cost, like lost touch of family,
parents or childhoods friends even lost the value of life. Every body wishes
them good luck, they have no money no lands no identity. Only they little pieces
of diamond call (Education). They have plane that they will exchange their
diamond for gold nugget. Before the start of journey, their Grand Ma remind them
about faith of religion and discipline, at any places at any moment remember
that Oh! Mighty God save me from the danger. Then second request come from their
baby bother will we go with you, but elder bother answer no not right now (Grow
up and study hard and we will wait for you that dream land. Baby bother ask what
we will study? Big bother say one word Computer!! Any way journey start for the
gold mine. On dream journey was very smooth but practical life it was very
unpleasant, no money no land no identity, road is very rough. Lost emotion lost
touch of all family only man and woman both are same focus for gold mine.
Sunshine and thunder, cloud and rain make them closer each other. Finally they
founded the Gold mine hip hip hurray! Right now time to collect and put in the
bucket. One bucket, two bucket, three bucket, bucket after bucket then they
field tried they decide they will stop after ten bucket, but when ten bucket
full they wanted one more bucket, one more one more. So much temptation, after
one bucket full man say lets go back to our home land but woman say No one more
bucket. Next day woman day that’s enough lets go but man say No one more,
every hours every day months after months years after years gone they could not
realize so may years gone. Baby bother turning to a young man and he has same
dream and he started for same journey. Man and woman welcome them with open
heart and finally re-union with a big family. Every body happy every body
singing a new song healthy, happy and prospers life. Happy and freedom. Oh no!
Where the monster come from, Look he is eating every single piece of gold my god
stock market down so much, Look at mortgage rate Oh no look so many houses on
sale side of the road. Mr. Dow and Mr. Index are on the roller coaster. The
monster could not recognize us what land we come from What we will do, Oh mighty
god save us from this monster Man and Woman remember Grand father use to sing a
song to call mighty god Jago Durga! Jago Josodha Jago Bishwa Mata! So Man and
