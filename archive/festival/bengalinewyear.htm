      <h4>The Origin of Bangla new year and celebrating Pahela Baishakh</h4>
      <p>Pahela Baishakh is indeed a momentous occasion in the life of each and
      every Bengalee. It is the first day of Bangla calendar year. To every
      Bengalee, young and old, rich and poor, wise and ignorant, it is a time of
      gaiety to be celebrated with great merry-making, to be enjoyed in every
      possible manner, an occasion which enables us, in the words of Tennyson,
      to drink life to the lees.' It is a cruel irony of fate that a few
      orthodox Muslims in our country, shrouded by sheer ignorance, look down
      upon this Nababarsha festival, simply because they inadvertently consider
      it to be a festival of non-Muslim origin. But there is no shadow of doubt
      that the Bangla calendar that we follow today was introduced by the
      Muslims in this sub-continent.</p>
      <p>The Pahela Baishakh so warmly celebrated all over the country today
      originated not from Bangladesh, but from an entirely different part of
      this sub-continent more than thousand miles away. What is more, the Bangla
      Saal was introduced not by any Bangladeshi but by a non-Bengalee in whose
      grandfather's vein flowed the blood of both Gengis Khan and Tamerlane.</p>
      <p>Yes, what is popularly known as Bangla Saal today saw the light of day
      through an ordinance promulgated by Akbar the Great, the renowned grandson
      of Zahiruddin Muhammad Babar whose mother and father were descendants of
      Gengis Khan and Tamerlane respectively. It was to immortalise a momentous
      occasion, a crucial juncture of history that the great Moghul introduced
      this new system of calendar 415 years ago.</p>
      <p>The calendar so introduced was originally known as Tarikh-e-Elahi and
      it was introduced on the 10th or the 11th March in the 29th year of
      Akbar's reign i.e. in 1585 A. D. It , however, dates from the day of
      Akbar's ascension to the throne of Delhi and commemorates his coronation
      as the Emperor of India in 1556. The Second Battle of Panipath and the
      Coronation of Akbar as the Emperor of India are indeed great events in the
      annals of history. The Moguls had nearly lost the throne of Delhi for
      good. Akbar was not even an adult when the life of Humayun was suddenly
      cut short on the stairs of his own library.</p>
      <p>What is more, the mighty and competent Hindu general Himu, the
      Commander-in-Chief of Islam Shah, had conquered both Delhi and Agra and
      declared himself Raj Chakravarty. It seemed that the days of the Great
      Moghuls were numbered and they would be driven out from the sub-continent
      for ever. But the brave and indomitable Akbar rose to the occasion and
      faced the music with courage and conviction. With the able guidance and
      help of Bairam Khan, Akbar created history by defeating the invincible'
      army of Himu at the Second Battle of Panipat on the 5th of November, 1556.
      This was indeed a momentous occasion in the annals of history. It not only
      re- established the Moghul dynasty on the Indian soil but also ensured its
      continuation for many a year to come. As a result, the Moghuls ruled over
      this sub-continent with glory and greatness for three hundred years more.
      It was the greatest achievement in Akbar's chequered life and undoubtedly
      one of the greatest events in the Moghul history. It was to glorify and
      immortalise the historic event and also to facilitate the collection of
      revenue during harvest in a more systematic way that Akbar the Great
      introduced Tarikh-e-Elahi form the 10th of Rabiul Awal in 963 A.H.</p>
      <p>It may be mentioned in this connection that from the very beginning of
      his reign, Akbar felt the need of introducing a uniform scientific,
      workable and acceptable system of calculating days and months through a
      reformed calendar. With this end in view, he commissioned Amir Fathullah
      Shirazi, a distinguished scientist and the most famous astronomer of the
      day, to make a recommendation for the reformed calendar. Abul Fazal, the
      renowned scholar and a minister of Akbar the Great, in his scholarly work
      Akbar Namah, gives details of the events leading to the new era under the
      Royal Forman of Akbar. Abul Fazal explains that the use of the Hijrah
      (Hegira) Era was unfair to the peasantry, because 31 lunar years were
      equal to 30 solar years and the revenue was collected on the basis of
      lunar years whereas the harvest depended on the solar ones. Abul Fazal was
      right because the lunar year consists of 354 days and the solar years has
      365 or 366 days. Thus there is difference of II or 12 days between the
      lunar and the solar years.</p>
      <p>The Forman (Royal Proclamation) ran as follows: &quot;In this dominion
      adorning time and auspicious epoch, when a Qarn (cycle) of the victorious
      session on throne of sovereignty has elapsed, and good day of fortune has
      begun to smile, a world- obeyed' Forman was issued to the effect that the
      governors of the Imperial dominions, and the other offices of state and
      finance, who in accordance with their degrees and positions, are
      recipients of the royal favours, should know as follows:</p>
      <p>'Whereas the great officers of the court have represented to us as
      follows:&quot; It is not hidden from the Inspired Kind that the object of
      establishing an era is that the seasons of affairs and events may be known
      with ease, and no one has any occasion for alteration.</p>
      <p>Suppose, for example, someone makes a contract, or takes a favour or a
      loan, and the period of execution be 4 years, 4 months: unless the exact
      date of the beginning be known, it will be difficult, or rather
      impossible, to determine the date of completion. It is event too that
      whenever an era has prevailed for a long time, the establishment of a new
      one opens the gates of ease and prosperity for all mankind.</p>
      <p>The repeated representation of this body of men, and regard for their
      positions, prevailed and were accepted, and an order was issued that the
      new year, which followed close on the year of ascension, should be made
      the foundation of the Divine Era, and that the gates of joy and comfort
      should be opened.</p>
      <p>Also that in the almanacs of India they (the almanac writers) should
      enter this new era instead of their discordant eras..... and that they do
      away with their various eras. And whereas in the almanacs current in India
      the years were solar, and the months lunar, we ordered that the months of
      the new era should be solar.'</p>
      <p>Abul Fazal eulogises the Forman of 992 A.H. (1584 A.D.) in the
      following way: The pillar of the founders of the Sacred Era was the
      learned of the age, the Plato of cycles (Alwani) Amir Fathullah Shirazi
      whose title was Azad-ud-Daula. It was he who in a happy hour laid the
      foundation of this heavenward soaring edifice. Although the foundation
      (i.e. the Forman) took place in 992 A.H. yet the position of events dates
      from the beginning of the sacred accession of Akbar.</p>
      <p>He further adds: The Forman ordered that the new year which followed
      close on the year of accession should be made the foundation of the Divine
      Era and accordingly the first of Muharram (the first month of the Hegira
      calendar) of 963 A.H. being close to the historic occasion was also made
      the starting point of the Tarikh-e-Elahi.&quot; Since the month of
      Muharram coincided with the Bengali month of Baishakh in 963 A.H., the
      month of Baishakh in Bengal was made the first month of the Bengali Era
      instead of the month of Chaitra which was the first month of the Shaka Era
      being practised in the then Bengal.</p>
      <p>The months of the new Bengali Era (or Tarikh-e-Elahi) were initially
      known as Karwadin, Ardi, 'Vihisu, Khordad, Teer, Amardad, Shahriar, Aban,
      Azur, Dai, Baham and Iskander Miz. Nobody knows for sure how and when we
      started naming the months as Baishakh, Jaishtha, etc. It is presumed that
      these months, based on the names of the stars, were derived from the
      Shakabda which was introduced in 78 A.D. to commemorate the reign of the
      Shaka dynasty in this subcontinent.</p>
      <p>The star-based names of the months were derived as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>Baishakh from the star known as Bishakha
        <li>Jiashthya from Jaishtha
        <li>Ashara from Shar
        <li>Sraban from Srabani
        <li>Bhadra from Bhadrapada
        <li>Ashwin from Aswaini
        <li>Kartik from Kartika
        <li>Agrahayon from Agraihon
        <li>Poush from Poushya
        <li>Magh from Magha
        <li>Falgun from Falguni, and
        <li>Chaitra from Chitra stars.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Some claim inadvertently that the Bangla calendar was introduced by
      Shashanka, king of Bengal, to commemorate his conquest of Assam. But
      records testify to the fact the Shashanka, son of Maha Sengupta, conquered
      Benaras and moved towards Chilka lake and never towards Assam.</p>
      <p>The system of celebrating Nababarsha or Pahela Baishakh (Ist of Baishak)
      was also introduced by Akbar the Great. After introducing Tarikh-e-Elahi,
      he abolished the hitherto practised Muslim festivals and replaced them by
      14 new festivals, one of which was Nawroze or the celebration of the New
      Year's Day. It was the celebration of Nawroze which enabled Prince Selim
      (later emperor Jehangir) to meet and fall in love with Meherunnisa (known
      as Nurjahan in history). It was again in one such Nawroze festival that
      the Prince Khurram (known as the Emperor Shahjahan in history) first came
      across Mumtaz Mahal, whom he immortalised through the great &quot;poetry
      in marble&quot; known the world over as Taj Mahal. Had there been no
      Nababarsha (or Nawroze) festival, there perhaps would be no Nurjahan, and
      no Taj Mahal.</td>
