      <P><font size="2"  color="#800080">Holi - from its mythological 
        past to its present. The festival of Holi actually starts the night before 
        with a bonfire made up of all the dried leaves and branches left through 
        the winter. It is a way of clearing these and making way for spring. Metaphorically 
        though, the fire is meant to signify the destruction of evil - the burning 
        of the ‘Holika’ - a mythological character. The heat from the fire is 
        also a reminder that winter is behind and that the hot summer days are 
        ahead. </font></P>

      <P><font size="2"  color="#800080">The following morning begins 
        with worshipping Krishna by lovingly smearing his idol with ‘gulal’ - 
        the colours used to play Holi. This is a festival that is as much a gateway 
        to celebrate the arrival of spring as much as it is a way to celebrate 
        the season of love. Krishna is the ultimate lover with his ‘gopikas’, 
        who are a bunch of beautiful women that Krishna forever seems to be chasing. 
        And yet this icon of love spends most of his time seeking out his only 
        lover Radha. So Krishna’s love is the epitome of the freshness of youth 
        amidst all its playfulness. Without Krishna and his lover Radha there 
        can be no Holi. </font></P>

    <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"> 
      <P><font size="2"  color="#004040">Krishna’s 
        mythological presence in Holi is undisputed. It is said that the festival 
        is also a celebration of the death of Pootna - the demon who nearly killed 
        Lord Krishna. The effigy of Pootna burnt the night before, therefore, 
        ends up signifying death itself just as Pootna typifies winter and darkness.

      <P><font size="2"  color="#804040">There 
        are more stories. This is the one about Holika who believed herself to 
        be immuned to death by fire. And yet when she questions her nephew Prahlad’s 
        devotion to the ultimate of Gods, Vishnu and threatens to walk through 
        fire with the intention to destroy the prince, she is herself consumed 
        by the fire whereas the prince comes out unscathed. This is the Holika 
        that is burnt the night before Holi as the triumph of the good over evil.

      <P><font size="2"  color="#004080">This 
        is where the celebration with colours comes in. Holi is supposed to be 
        an exuberant show of goodwill and cheer. The riot of colours follows a 
        revelry of colour play - quite unmatched in its boisterousness - and takes 
        place amidst the sprinkling or the shower of coloured powder. And when 
        this is combined with water it is anything but a damp squib. Everybody 
        is welcome and everybody is pardoned for his or her revelry.</font></P>
