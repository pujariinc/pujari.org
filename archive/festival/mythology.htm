<h4><img src="../_image/saptami2.jpg" align="left" width="118" height="220"> <span class="subhdred">The
myth</span></h4>
<p>Aeons ago, a demon Mahishasur earned the favour of Lord Brahma after a long
meditation. Pleased with his devotion, Brahma blessed him with a boon that no
man or god would be able to take his life. Empowered, Mahishasur unleashed a
reign of terror on the world, and even usurped the throne of heaven. Driven from
heaven, the Gods approached the holy trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
Angered by the atrocities committed by Mahishasur, the Trinity unleashed their
rage in the form of luminous energy. Great flames issued forth in all
directions, the fires illuminating all three worlds: heaven, earth and the
nether-world in penetrating light.</p>
<p>The energy of their fires coalesced at a single point to take the form of a
young woman. Her face was from the light of Shiva.</p>
Her ten arms were from Lord Vishnu. Her legs were from Lord Brahma. All the Gods
present contributed their share of energy to this goddess, and thus Durga, the
eternal mother, was born.
<p>Each God blessed her and gave her divine gifts: Pinakadhrik gave her a
trident, Krishna gave her a disc, Barun gave her a conch and the Agni gave her a
missile. From Paban she received arrows. The king of Gods, Indra, gave her a
thunderbolt, and the gift of his white-skinned elephant, Oirabat, was a bell.
From Yamraj, the God of death, Durga received a rod, and from the Ruler of
Waters she was given a noose. Many other precious and magical treasures were
also given to Durga: gifts of jewels, new clothing and a garland of immortal
lotuses. Heaven's architect, Bishwakarma, gave her a bright axe and magic armour.
Himavat, the God of mountains, gave her a magnificent lion to ride into battle.</p>
<img src="../_image/pot.jpg" align="right" width="121" height="145">Equipped
with the fearsome weaponry and dressed in golden armour and jewels, Durga set
off, on her lion whose thunderous roars shook the three worlds. Oceans boiled
and surf poured overland. Continents were torn at their granite foundations.
Whole new chains of mountains rose, while older ranges crumbled, cracked and
gave way to dust in a thousand landslides. The cataclysms rippled in waves
through all the three worlds, drawing the attention of Mahishasura and his
demonic allies.
<p>The demons had little time to admire the radiant visage of Durga before she
engaged them on the battlefield.</p>
She first met the army of Chikasura and then that of Chamara, Mahishasura's
chief commanders, destroying both in great battles. At first, confident of his
overwhelming power, Mahishasura held in reserve his personal demon-army.
However, it soon became obvious to him that even his personal guard must be
completely committed or he would surely be cast out of heaven.
<p><img src="../_image/arms.gif" align="left" width="54" height="324">Onto the
battlefield swarmed that most demonic assemblage, with its gruesome hordes of
infantry wielding their menacing collection of dark iron axes and gory
bludgeons. Leading this evil array in its mad and desperate charge, were
thousands of charioteers and cavalries of horses and elephants. Amidst this
chaos, Durga roamed the battlefield on her mighty lion. From her divine breath,
her army was constantly replenished with new warriors, each able, brave and
resolute. With her bell she confused the demons, and many were dragged away,
bound and chained. Her divine sword scattered the demon army and cut it to bits.
So many demons and elephants and horses died that a river of blood flowed across
the battlefield. The ground was left littered with the broken limbs and body
parts of the defeated demon-warriors. Durga was then attacked by the demon
commanders, who were killed in turn. As his army and commanders perished,
Mahisasur reverted once more to his own animal form, the wild buffalo. He
retreated into the mountains where he hurled boulders at Durga with his horns.
The Mother of the Universe drank the divine nectar, gift of Kuvera, and
transformed into Devi Chandika, the most ferocious form of the Goddess. She
leaped at Mahishasura, pushing him to the ground with her left leg. She grasped
his head in one hand, pierced him with her sharp spear held in another, and with
yet another hand she wielded her bright sword, beheading him. At last he fell
dead, and the scattered remnants of his once invincible army fled in terror. The
gods returned to heaven, and along with the sages of the earth, sang praises to
Goddess Durga.</p>
Durga Puja, the greatest of Hindu festivals, is - in its essence - a celebration
of the victory of good over evil. It symbolises the eternal truth, and this is
the time for peace and brotherhood.
<h4>Akalbodhan</h4>
<img src="../_image/durga.jpg" align="left" width="229" height="101">Durga was
conventionally worshipped during the spring season or Basanta. But according to
the Ramayana, the ritual of Akalbodhan or untimely worship was initiated by Lord
Ram when he worshipped the goddess in autumn. Before his final battle with Ravan,
Ram sought the blessings of the goddess. Supposed to offer a hundred neelkamals
or blue lotuses to Durga, Ram could only gather ninety-nine. Finally, Ram
decided to cut out one of his eyes, since they resembled blue lotuses. Durga,
pleased with his intense devotion, appeared before him and blessed him for his
imminent confrontation. The combat started on what we know as Saptami, and Ravan
was finally killed at the juncture between Ashtami and Nabami, or the
Sandhikkhan. Ravan's body was cremated on Dashami.
<h4>Bengali belief.</h4>
<p>Daksha, the king of the himalayas and the plains, and his wife, Menoka, had a
daughter called Uma. Uma, right from her childhood, started worshipping Shiva as
her would be husband. Shiva, being pleased with the worship of Uma, came to
marry her. Daksha did not like this tiger-skin clad groom with ash &amp; dirt
spread over all of his body. Uma got married to Shiva but was prevented by her
father from moving to Kailash, the abode of Shiva. Daksha, later on, arranged
for a 'yagna' where everyone except Shiva was invited. Uma, feeling ashamed of
the behaviour of her father and shocked by the attitude metted towards her
husband, went on fast and finally died. Shiva came to know about this and went
to Daksha's house. He lifted the body of Uma on his shoulders and started
dancing madly. With the supreme power dancing, the World was on the verge of
destruction. Narayana, another SuperGod, came forward as a saviour and used his
'Chakra' to cut the Body of Uma into pieces. Those pieces started falling off
from the shoulder of the dancing Shiva into different parts of the World. Shiva
was finally pacified when the last piece fell off from his shoulder. Narayana
revived Uma for a new life. Daksha, who was extremely sorry about his misdeeds,
prayed for mercy and was finally forgiven. The places where the pieces had
fallen are known as the 'Shakti Piths' or energy pits, few of these places being
Kalighat in Calcutta, Kamakshya near Guwahati among others. Ever since peace was
restored, Uma, with her four children, Ganesh, Kartick, Saraswati and Laxmi and
with her two 'sakhis' - Jaya and Bijaya, comes to visit her parent's home each
year during the season of 'Sharat' or autumn when Durga Puja is celebrated.</p>
<h4>The Goddess in other forms</h4>
Goddess Durga is worshipped by many names in different parts of India. Some of
these are: Navaratra or Navapatrika (in West India), Amba (in Kashmir), Hingala
or Rudrani (in Gujarat), Kalyani (in Kanauj), Ambika (in Deccan), Uma (in
Mithila), Jagadhhatri or Durga (in Bengal), Naini Devi (in U.P.), and Vaishno
Devi (in Jammu).
<h4>The Season</h4>
The goddess is worshipped in the season of Sharat, and hence the occasion is
also known as Sharadotsab. The coming of the season is heralded by the welcome
nip in the autumnal air at dawn, accompanied by the fragrance of shefali and
shiuli flowers that carpet the ground. In the mornings, the blades of grass
remain heavily laden with dew. The grains in the fields turn to gold amidst
clumps of snowy kaash flowers.
<p>People exchange gifts and new clothes, give their homes and offices a
thorough pre-Puja cleaning, listen to new music albums and read festive numbers
of magazines specially brought out as part of the widespread celebrations. This
spirit of well-being and happiness is cherished during the Puja days, and
eagerly awaited for throughout the rest of the year.</p>
<h4>The Puja</h4>
The main ritual of Durga Puja spans a period of four days. However, in case of
traditional and household pujas, the festivities last till ten days. Debi-Pakkha
is the name given to the fortnight from the new moon till the next full moon.
This is the most propitious time for performing holy rites. The ritual of
drawing the eyes on the image of the goddess is called chakkhu-daan. Symbolising
the process of infusing the image with the power of vision, this is done on
Mahalaya, the day of the new moon.
<p>The main puja starts from <b>Shasthi</b>, which is the sixth day after the
new moon. On <b>Saptami</b>, the image of the goddess is infused with life
through a process called Bodhon. Early in the morning, the pran of the Devi is
put inside the image after it is brought from a nearby river through the medium
of a banana plant, called the Kola Bou. The Kola Bou, bathed and draped in a new
yellow saree, resembles a newly wed bride. <b>Ashtami</b> is universally
accepted as the culminating point of the four day celebrations. It was on this
day that Durga had killed Mahishasura. The ritual of <b>Sandhipuja</b> marks <b>Sandhikkhan</b>,
the juncture between <b>Ashtami</b> and <b>Nabami</b>. The main attraction of
Nabami is the <b>Maha-Arati</b> held in the evening. On <b>Dashami</b>, the
image is immersed in a river, and people bid a sorrowful farewell to the Mother
Goddess, and the wait begins for yet another year.</p>
<b>Bijoya</b> is a special ritual whereby peace and good relations are
reaffirmed. Families exchange sweets and people embrace each other, vowing
brotherhood. Bijoya continues till the next new moon, when Kali Puja is held.
<h4>The Image</h4>
In Sri Sri Chandi, Goddess Durga is described to be endowed with ten hands, each
holding a weapon required for killing the wicked forces and also for expressing
the abhaya mudra to her devotees.
<p>According to tradition, the images of Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartick and Ganesh
are also separately worshipped along with that of Durga. The image of Durga is
framed at the centre, and the background behind the whole group is called the
chaal-chitra. It is a circular canvas of mat containing paintings of heavenly
scenes and drawings of other important gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>The images that are worshipped in the different pujas of the city are mostly
crafted in Kumartuli. This is the neighbourhood of kumars or potters, a
community of artisans who specialise in making clay images of deities. In the
days leading up to the Durga Puja, Kumartuli is a fascinating hive of activity.
This form of art has been a hereditary source of livelihood for the kumars for
more than a century.</p>
