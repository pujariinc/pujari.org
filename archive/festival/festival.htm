      community puja is one of the most spectacular events in Bengal. It starts
      with molding the idol, a clay image of the deity. The idol is fashioned
      from a straw armature coated with clay and modeled to the image of the
      deity, then mounted on a structure embellished with sola pith or tinsel,
      and installed in the <em>Puja Pandal</em>, a dais made of bamboo and
      pleated cloth, decorated with Chandeliers and neon lights. Musical and
      cultural shows, exhibitions and fairs are held around the <em>pandal.</em></p>

      <p style="line-height: 100%">A festival lasts several days. On the
      occasion of Durga and Kali Pujas, special drummers, the Dhakis, using huge
      powerful drums made of a hollow mango tree branch and goat skin, play
      during the festival. On the last day, the murti is carried by cheering
      devotees in festive processions, sometimes preceded by bagpipes or band
      parties, to the river where it is immersed. The main Hindu festivals in
      Bengal are Durga Puja, Lakshmi Puja, Kali Puja and Saraswati Puja.</p>
