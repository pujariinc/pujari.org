<h1 align="center">Saraswati Puja</h1>
<p align="justify"><img src="../_image/saraswati3.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="131" height="521">Saraswati
is the Goddess of knowledge. She is the Goddess of speech (in Sanskrit <i>Vac</i>),
that which Flows. This also has an association to water. It is said Saraswati
was the Goddess of the river of the same name. On the banks of the river
Saraswati, sages developed language. She revealed language to man. Thus she is
the Goddess of knowledge and learning. She represents the union of power and
intelligence from which organized creation arises. Saraswati possesses all the
learning of the Vedas, scriptures, dancing, music and poetry. Her origin is in
the lost Vedic river Saraswati. This is the source of her profound connection
with fluidity in any aspect (water, speech, thought…). She embodies wisdom,
fortune, intelligence, nourishment, brilliance, contentment, splendor and
devotion. She is depicted as a gracefully seated or standing goddess, holding a <i>veena</i>,
a musical instrument, a rosary and the scripture. The <i>‘bahon’</i> are the
swan and the peacock. The instrument symbolizes knowledge of the arts held in
high esteem in Vedic tradition. The rosary points to the meditative qualities
necessary to acquire knowledge. The scripture is knowledge in itself. The swan
signifies discrimination between right and wrong, while the peacock points to
the mundane, the unstable.

Saraswati Puja has tremendous importance among Bengalis. <i>Ma Saraswati</i> is
the Goddess whom we all worship to get her blessing to do well in our studies.
Saraswati Puja is celebrated to pay obeisance the goddess of knowledge and
learning and is held in January/February when winter is coming to an end, spring’s
starting. It falls on fifth day of the waxing moon of the Magha month of the
Indian solar calendar. The day is called 'Basant Panchami'. She is daughter of
Durga and wife of Lord Brahma. She is also known as Gayatri. Saraswati possesses
powers of speech, wisdom and learning. In fact her knowledge is regarded to be
more superior than the Vedas, She embraces almost all the arts and sciences.
Saraswati does not do any <i>saj-goj</i> (deck herself with costly gems and
jewels). Dressed in pure white, she rides a <i>rajhansa</i> (swan). She is
believed to illumine whole world with light of knowledge and dispel darkness of
ignorance. She holds book in one hand and <i>veena</i> in another. She may come
with four hands too - symbolizing learning, intellect, alertness and ego
respectively. Students pray to her for her blessings so that they can excel in
studies.</p>
<p align="justify">Saraswati is essentially an Aryan Goddess. Aryan settlements
of ancient India were mainly along the banks of the rivers. Saraswati was one
such river. Accumulation of wealth provided Aryans with leisure which in turn
created an ideal situation for growth of knowledge, arts and crafts. Saraswati
as Goddess of learning was now treasured. Once King Ambuvici, after having known
the great powers of Saraswati, made an earthen image of hers.</p>
<p align="justify"><img src="../_image/saraswati6.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="228" height="237">The
idol of Saraswati wears white clothes, to indicate the onset of spring and the
blossoming of mustard flowers. Families dressed in bright yellow gather together
before the idol of Saraswati and pray for the blessing of knowledge. Flowers and
wild berries are offered to the goddess and students place their books before
the deity and do not do any reading or writing that day. An elaborate puja, with
sandalwood, ghee, joss sticks, and incense is done to the sound of shlokas,
conch shells, and drums.</p>
<p align="justify">Saraswati Puja is also known as <i>‘Boi Puja’</i> (a
worship of books) in Bengal. The puja starts early in the morning with <i>‘aaroti’</i>.
Students are supposed to be on a fast before the puja. Books, pens, pencils,
musical instruments, chalk are kept before altar of the Goddess. <i>‘Boi’</i>
(books) is almost considered as the soul of <i>Ma Saraswati</i>. So, when one
accidentally puts his feet on even a page of a books, he makes a <i>‘pronam’</i>
(bows ones head with respect) in order to undo his misdeed of trampling on <i>Ma
Saraswati’s</i> soul. An earthen pot is decorated with mango leaves and floral
designs are drawn with rice grain paste. Incense, green and dry fruits are
offered to Goddess. Saraswati Puja ends with <i>‘pushpanjali’</i> which is
performed thrice. Then <i>pushpanjali</i> (floral offering) is performed by
reciting the following mantra thrice:</p>
<img src="../_image/saraswati4.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="150" height="148">Saraswati
mahabhage vidye kamalalochane<br>
Viswarupe vishalakshi vidyangdehi namastute<br>
Esho shachandana pushpa bilvapatranjali<br>
Namo Saraswatvayi devyayi namoh
<p align="justify">An intrinsic aspect of the puja is a child’s <i>‘Hatey
Khori’</i> - the inauguration ceremony to a child’s learning - the child
writes some letters in front of Goddess. After the <i>pushpanjali</i>, the
father or any other elder and guides the child's hand on the slate to write the
first letter. This is <i>Aum</i>. This is followed usually by a few letters of
the Bangla vowels and consonants and nowadays, the English ones as well. It is
considered an auspicious day to begin a child’s education.</p>
<p align="justify"><img src="../_image/saraswati5.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="150" height="200">This
puja is celebrated in all schools and colleges. Schools, colleges and
educational institutes are closed whole day. Students take break from their
studies for the day to pay their respect to Goddess Saraswati. Young boys and
girls could be seen engaged in the preparation of pujas from early morning. From
cutting of fruits to assisting the priest, everything is taken care of by the
students. No matter whether a student is religious or irreligious, everyone
participates in this in the hope of doing, well in their examinations. The young
girls wear <i>‘Basanti’</i> (shade of orange) coloured sarees and put <i>‘alta’</i>
on their feet and go to school. The demure footsteps delicately balancing their
sarees are wonderful scene. The elders think that their younger daughters have
suddenly grown. In evening they put up cultural programmes accompanied by dance
and drama. The following evening the images of the Goddess go for <i>‘bisorjon’</i>
in Ganges.</p>
<p align="justify">Saraswati Puja is also the day of eating plums. Plums, called
<i>‘kool’</i> in Bengali is the most sought after fruit on the day of
Saraswati Puja. <i>‘Kooler Chatni’</i> and <i>‘Kooler Achar’</i> is a
must for that day. <i>Kool</i> or plum is a fruit of spring time.</p>
