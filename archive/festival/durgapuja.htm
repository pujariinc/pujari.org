<p align="left">Needless to say what it reminds you, if you are a Bengali. For
others, it is a clip of the traditional Bengali festival, called &quot;Durga
Puja&quot; or &quot;Puja&quot; in brief.</p>
Divine Mother, Durga, who exists in all beings in the form of intelligence,
mercy, beauty, who is the consort of Lord Shiva, who creates, sustains and
destroys the universe.
<p><img border="0" src="../_image/durga.gif" align="left" width="75" height="75">Durga
Puja commences on the first and ends on the tenth day of the bright half of
Ashwin (September-October). It is held in commemoration of the victory of Durga
over Mahishasura, the buffalo-headed demon. Her image is worshipped for four
days and then cast into water, it starts on seventh moon day and ends on tenth
moon day. The tenth day is called Bijaya Dasami. Processions with Her image are
taken out along the streets of villages and cities.</p>
The mother of Durga (that is, the wife of the King of the Himalayas) longed to
see her daughter. Durga was permitted by Lord Shiva to visit her beloved mother
only for nine days in the year. The festival of Durga Puja marks this brief
visit and ends with the Bijaya Dasami day, when the Goddess Durga leaves for her
return to Mount Kailas. This is the view of the devotees in Bengal.
<p><img border="0" src="../_image/durgaface.gif" width="104" height="135" align="left">Durga
Puja is the greatest Hindu festival in which God is adored as Mother. Hinduism
is the only religion in the world which has emphasized to such an extent the
motherhood of God. One's relationship with one's mother is the dearest and the
sweetest of all human relations.</p>
In Bengal, Durga Puja is a great festival, it is more of the Bengalis festival
than the Hindu festival. All who live away from home return during the Puja
days. Mothers reunite with their sons and daughters, and wives with their
husbands.
<p><img border="0" src="../_image/bijoya1.gif" width="100" height="115" align="left">The
woman of Bengal welcomes the Goddess with a mother's love and sends away the
image on the last day, with every ceremony associated with a daughter's
departure to her husband's home and with motherly tears in her eyes. This
signifies the parting of Durga from Her beloved mother.</p>
