The written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of   the proceedings of the Members. The action by written consent shall have the   same force and effect as the vote of the Members.</p>
        <p>3.7 Membership Rights. No Member shall have any   right or interest in any of the property or assets of the Corporation. All   corporate property is irrevocably dedicated to the purposes described within   these Bylaws and the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation.
